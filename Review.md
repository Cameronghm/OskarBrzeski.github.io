# Review - Group 1
This is the review of the group project by group 1, on the 5 points listed in the marking criteria.

## Interest of Content
The content was varied across many different areas where computer science has made a positive impact.

### Mark: Excellent (7/10)

## Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation
- The visual presentation was consistent across all of the webpages but however, the colour scheme was very bland and not very visually stimulating.
- The navigation bar didn't add much to the website and contained no links to any actual webpages, losing a lot of potential functionality.
- On some pages the text extended beyond the main container and into the footer leading to somewhat unreadable text.
- The links on the left sidebar were okay, but could've been jazzed up a lot more, much like the rest of the website :D
